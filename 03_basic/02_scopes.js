// closure 
// A closure is a function that remembers the variables from its lexical scope, even after that scope has exited.
// Lexical scope means that the scope of a variable is determined by its position in the source code (not by how or where the function is called at runtime).
// âœ… Definition:
// A closure is created when a function is defined inside another function and accesses variables from the outer function.
